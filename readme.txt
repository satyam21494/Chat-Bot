Project Name: Discussion Thread

creating functionality for discussion thread with client and admin. This will include the following features:
1. Client will be able to create a new discussion thread. Inputs: Client name, Subject and Message
2. Client and admin will be able to see all the threads started
4. Client/Admin can reply to the thread. Input: Replier name [Auto fill] and Message


For now i have shown only for users say(1 client and 1 admin) but client can start multiple discussion threads.

Whenever client starts new thread or replies to a thread, this will automatically go in [Waiting for reply from admin] 
and vice-versa for admin. Both client and admin can close the thread at any time.
